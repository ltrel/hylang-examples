# Hylang Examples
This is a collection of code examples written in the Hy programming language. The aim of this repository is to help those interested in learning Hy by providing well-documented possible solutions to common programming problems. As a bit of a disclaimer, I'm no Lisp expert and am far more comfortable writing Python, so I may not be doing things the best way possible, but I hope this can still be useful to programmers coming from a similar background.
