# Hylang Examples ðŸ¦‘
This is a collection of code examples written in the Hy programming language. The aim of this repository is to help those interested in learning Hy by providing well-documented solutions to common programming problems, demonstrations of the language features, and other cool stuff. As a bit of a disclaimer, I'm no Lisp expert and am far more comfortable writing Python, so I may not be doing things the best way possible, but I hope this can still be useful to programmers coming from a similar background.
## List of Programs
- FizzBuzz
- Binary search algorithm
- Quicksort sorting algorithm (simplified)
- Sierpinski Triangle (requires Pillow/PIL)
- More stuff coming soon
